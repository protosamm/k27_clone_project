# K72.ca Website Clone – Demo

This project is a **demo clone of the K72.ca website**, built using **React**, **Tailwind** and **GSAP**.  
It is **not a full clone**, but a showcase of what can be recreated using modern front-end tools and animation libraries.

The goal of this demo is to replicate the look and feel of the original site’s animations as closely as possible, while keeping the implementation simple and understandable.

## 🚀 Features
- React-based interface  
- Smooth GSAP animations  
- Partial recreation of the original K72.ca layout and transitions  
- Clean, modern front-end structure  

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **React**
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**
- CSS / SCSS  
- JavaScript / JSX

## 📌 Notes
This is **not yet a full clone** — more like a starting point or concept demo.  
I plan to continue updating it to **look and work even better** in the future.

## 📈 Future Improvements
- More accurate animation timing and transitions  
- Additional pages and sections  
- Improved responsiveness  
- Cleaner component architecture
